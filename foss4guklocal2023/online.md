## FOSS4G:UK Local 2023 - Online

National Chair: [Nick Bearman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbearman/)


### Location & Travel

As well as providing venues in 8 locations across the UK & Ireland, we are aiming to stream as many of our sessions as possible online. These will be streamed to YouTube on the day, with recordings made available on YouTube afterwards. Our primary aim is to make the streams available to each local venue and to record the sessions, but we are also able to make the streams public so you can watch online. Please note that anyone watching online will be limited to observing rather than participating - for the best experience, please do attend in person if you can. 

If you choose to watch online you are welcome to chat to other participants in the [OSGeo:UK & FOSS4G:UK Matrix Room](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org). Each YouTube channel will have a chat and you are welcome to chat there as well. During the talks the focus will be on questions provided in the room, so we may not be able to get to any questions you post in YouTube chat. Links and more details will be provided nearer the event.
