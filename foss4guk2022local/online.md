## FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 - Online access

If you can't make it to any of the venues, most of the sessions will be available live online, and will also be recorded so you can watch them later. We will be using the [FOSS4G UK YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FOSS4GUK/streams) for this. Youi don't need to register - just follow the instructions and links below.
