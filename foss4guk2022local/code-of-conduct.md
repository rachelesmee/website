# Code of Conduct for FOSS4G:UK Local 2022

## General Guidelines

FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 is a hybrid conference, happening in person (at a range of venues) and online. 

These guidelines are meant as a tool to help presenters and attendees have an enjoyable event, and should be read alongside the general [OSGeo Code of Conduct](https://www.osgeo.org/code_of_conduct/), which applies to all platforms and communication mediums.

Participants at FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 are expected to act respectfully toward others in accordance with the https://berlincodeofconduct.org/.

## Diversity Statement

OSGeo welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining, and we will always work to treat everyone well. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.


## Escalating and/Reporting a Problem

Issues that cannot be handled by the presentation host and co-host should be escalated to the OSGeo:UK conference committee by [e-mail](mailto:osgeouk@gmail.com).


## Meeting recordings

Most presentations will be recorded and uploaded to the FOSS4G:UK YouTube channel for public viewing. This is done on an opt-in basis, when you submit to the call for talks. We will also take photos during the events, and use these for publicity. This is done on an opt-in basis, when you register.  If you wish to change your mind, then you must explicitly contact the OSGeo:UK conference committee by [e-mail](mailto:osgeouk@gmail.com).

Presentations where a code of conduct violation is known to have occurred will be treated separately and a joint decision between the presenter, co-host, and the conference organising committee will be made as to whether the recording should be made available.

# Be Nice
This is a first time running a hybrid conference for us, we hope we have thought of everything and that the day runs smoothly. But if stuff goes wrong, please be patient, we will get problems fixed as fast as we can and will provide updates.
