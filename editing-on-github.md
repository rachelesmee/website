# Editing the website on GitHub

Through the power of GitHub, any one can make changes to this website. 

- Click on the Edit on [GitHub](https://github.com/osgeouk/website/blob/gh-pages/foss4guklocal2023/index.md) link.

- You will need to log in with your GitHub account, or create one if you don't have one. 

- Click on the pencil icon **Edit this file** in the top left corner: ![](images/github-edit.png)

- Make your changes *the website is written in markdown - it should be fairly easy to read!*

- Click **Commit changes...** ![](images/github-commit-changes.png)

- By default, you will be asked to **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. 

- Type in a little note explaining what you have changed and click **Propose changes**. ![](images/github-propose-changes.png) 

- This will create a **Pull Request** which someone from OSGeo:UK will review. 

- Thanks very much!
