# Improving severe-weather resilience for Mongolian and Kyrgyz herding communities using earth observation imagery (presentation)

Alison Hopkin, Deimos Space UK	

_SIBELIUs uses an Open Data Cube to provide improved pasture monitoring capabilities in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to support their herding communities._

SIBELIUs uses Open Data Cube (ODC) technology to provide improved pasture monitoring capabilities in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to support their large and economically significant herding communities. Satellite Earth observation provides an efficient means for monitoring environmental parameters, such as pasture, snow and drought, over large regions, which can facilitate improved pasture management decisions. The SIBELIUs team is working with key Mongolian and Kyrgyz stakeholders to develop ODC Technology to serve a wide range of users. SIBELIUS is supported by the UK Space Agency’s International Partnership Programme (IPP). In both Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan, SIBELIUs is using three existing networks to deliver the benefits of the project to the herding communities: (1) government agencies coordinating livestock and land use, (2) directly to the herders through social media, text messaging and television broadcasts, (3) through finance and insurance sectors.

# awesome-earthobservation-code (lightning talk)

Andrew Cutts, freelancer

_Finding Earth Observation code is hard. awesome-earthobservation-code attempts to address this. It has over 270+ resources in one place._

Earth Observation is one of the fastest growing areas of Geospatial today. Yet finding information about Earth Observation code (or even available commerical satellites) is harder than it should be. awesome-earthobservation-code attempts to address this. Built after a lunchtime scenefromabove discussion it currently has over 270+ resources in one place. I will set out some of the key information problems facing Earth Observation today and how awesome-earthobservation-code is a small step into building a bigger more vibrant community of collaborators.  https://github.com/acgeospatial/awesome-earthobservation-code 

# ArcGIS to QGIS in One Easy Lesson (demo)

Ant Scott, MapAction	

_This demo will showcase SLYR, an ArcGIS to QGIS toolkit from North Road, and its use by MapAction to support interoperability and partnership._

SLYR is a QGIS plugin which has been developed by North Road Software to provide a route for the conversion of ArcGIS artefacts for use in QGIS. While the process is not yet 100 % faithful to the original, it’s improving with regular releases. As well as a drag and drop facility for e.g. MSDs and layer files, the plugin also installs a set of tools in the Processing Toolbox which can be used independently and incoporated into processing models.  The context for the demo will be MapAction’s use of SLYR to support interoperability between its work with Arc (mainly used in emergency missions) and QGIS (used in training and capacity building), and in particular to allow Arc products created in humanitarian response missions to be converted to QGIS for handover at the end of the mission to partners who are QGIS users.  While the plugin has not yet been released as open source, North Road plan to do so once a specific funding threshold for development has been reached, with a six month delay. 

# My Thirty Years of Spatial Disease Modelling (presentation)

Barry Rowlingson,	Lancaster University	

_A review of "Open" in spatial epidemiology over the past thirty years._

Nearly thirty years ago I quit my Physics PhD and began to drag GIS, statistics and epidemiology kicking and screaming together, which I've been doing ever since. From a world with no WWW, no Linux, and no Open Source, we've come to a place where politically-motivated groups attack disease modellers on github over code used to inform government COVID-19 pandemic policy.  The talk will introduce some ideas in spatial statistics, epidemiology, and disease surveillance. It will show how the landscape has changed and how Open Source and Open Data are now influencing the debate around disease surveillance in the COVID-19 era. I'll outline how new technologies for reproducible research can bring about more openness and accountability for disease outbreak epidemiology.

# Using FOSS4G to track COVID-19 in Romania (demo)

Cristina Andra Vrînceanu,	geo-spatial.org

_Geo-spatial.org’s Covid-19 app, built entirely on FOSS, delivers correct, complete and updated official information on the virus spread in Romania._

Our platform contains several maps and graphs depicting the different dimensions of the pandemic in Romania, ranging from confirmed cases/deaths/healed patients and related statistics, to hospital infrastructure, quarantine zones to pollution/mobility indexes, as well as other impact indicators of this epidemic in our country. Unfortunately, the Romanian authorities have failed in communicating the evolution of the COVID-19, resulting in numerous glitches in different reports. Thus, we have been volunteering our time to collect detailed information from the local/national media, compare it to the official reporting, sort it and deliver it in a structured manner. The application is built using Node.js, PostgreSQL+PostGIS, R on the backend and OpenLayers, Angular, charts.js, Plotly and D3.js for the frontend. The source code is on GitHub [https://github.com/geospatialorg/covid19], MIT licensed. The infrastructure is supported by Sage Group [http://www.sage.ieat.ro/] on AWS and by Carto.

# Women in Geospatial+ - Changing the status-quo by creating a strong network of Women in Geospatial+ leaders and changemakers (presentation)

Cristina Vrînceanu, Julia Wagemann,	Women in Geospatial +

_Women in Geospatial+ is a professional network promoting gender-equality and diversity in geospatial field, aimed at women and other minority genders._

Women in Geospatial+ started in March 2019 and grew into a vibrant and active community with more than 1200 registered members from all over the world and over 4000 followers on social media. The fast growing pace of this community is a sign that many of us still witness gender-bias in the workplace and more diversity-focused initiatives are needed.   We provide our members with a safe platform for open and honest communication and exchange, sharing opportunities for career and personal development. To feature the work and achievements of women geospatial leaders, we hold regular in-person meetups at different geospatial events, run a mentorship program and have recently launched a speakers database.    We will highlight key activities of our network, current facts and figures on diversity in geospatial and explain how to join and contribute to the community’s success and expansion. Let’s change the status quo together by creating a strong network of leaders and change-makers.

# Don’t Lose Your Way!  Crowd sourcing the nation's forgotten paths (presentation)

Dan Ormsby, Jack Cornish, Matt Walker,	The Ramblers & Astun Technology

_Walking charity the Ramblers, crowd sourced every lost historic path in England and Wales in just 6 weeks.  We’ll look back at how, why and what next!_

In February and March 2020, every lost historic path in England and Wales was mapped in a crowd sourcing campaign run by the Ramblers using OS-Geo technologies at its heart. Attracting national media attention, over 3,500 volunteers did a “spot the difference” comparison of over 150,000 sq km of historic and contemporary OS maps and digitised the missing paths. The exercise is Phase 1 in a program to save historic rights of way before a legislative deadline of 2026 beyond which they will be lost forever. In this talk by Ramblers project lead Jack Cornish with Dan Ormsby and Matt Walker from Astun we’ll look at how, why and what next.

# Locus Charter - Helping to use location data ethically and responsibly (presentation)

Denise McKenzie,	Benchmark Initiative, Geovation

_The Locus Charter is an international set of principles and guidance for ethical and good practice in using location data._

In 2019 the Omidyar Network funded 2 programmes of work looking at ethical implications of using location data - Benchmark Initiative in the UK and EthicalGEO in the USA. Since then the world has seen an unprecedented situation arise with the spread of COVID-19 across most countries in the world. Location data has been at the fore of understand, predicting and trying to manage the outbreak. A key topic that has arisen during this has been the question "what constitutes ethical use of location data?" This is being openly debated particularly in the use of contact tracing apps that are being developed by many governments across the world. The Locus Charter is a collaboration between the teams a Benchmark and EthicalGEO to develop an agreed set of international principles to help guide practitioners towards the ethical and responsible use of location data in their projects. The program will be reaching its public consultation phase in June.   www.benchmarkinitiative.com www.ethicalgeo.org

# Stay home and innovate: redesigning an Earth Observation-fuelled accelerator supporting SMEs and start-ups (lightning talk)

Dimitrios Papadakis,	Evenflow SPRL

_The PARSEC Accelerator, distributing €2.5 Million to SMEs and start-ups, enabled innovation from the safety of home as a response to the COVID-19._

The PARSEC Accelerator, which will distribute €2.5 Million in equity-free funding for Earth Observation-based innovation, was one of the Copernicus-enabled business opportunities that Evenflow presented at the FOSS4G Bucharest in August 2019. After the successful start to 2020, with the PARSEC Open Call 1 attracting 348 SMEs and start-ups from 36 different countries and resulting in 100 competitive winners (#100PARSEC), the COVID-19 pandemic changed the rules of the game. The international team behind the accelerator committed to continue supporting innovation of SMEs, and therefore redesigned the first stage and the second Open Call of the accelerator. This enabled innovation to continue from the safety of home within the PARSEC ecosystem, and created a more open and borderless accelerator.

# Using FOSS to develop a spatial and temporal visualisation of COVID-19 data (lightning talk)

Eddie Boyle,	University of Edinburgh	

_A visualisation of the spatial and temporal distribution of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic using open technologies and resources._

There are many visualisations on all media platforms of datasets relating to the distribution of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Some are map-based, showing the geographic distribution of pandemic-related datasets (such as numbers of cases and deaths per country) and some are line and bar charts showing the variation of this data over time (such as curves of numbers of infections and recoveries).  Hardly any of these visualisations attempt to combine a spatial and temporal approach to the data in the same visualisation. Almost none do it successfully.  This lightning talk presents a web-based visualisation which attempts to do this, and a summary of the concepts and technical approaches used for its development. A FOSS and GIS-based approach to the data and software libraries used has been taken throughout.  The full visualisation can be seen at: https://bit.ly/2Xk6zTh. A blog posting describing the development of the visualisation can be seen at: https://bit.ly/3e9dCnT.

# The bloody guts of Tiff files (presentation)

Emily Selwood,	Satellite Applications Catapult Limited

_The humble tiff file is used for storing raster data, this talk will take a dive into the internal structure of the format._

The humble tiff file is used for storing raster data, when creating them there are many options, it can be difficult to know exactly what options mean and what the implications of them. This talk will dive into the internals of the file format, explaining the overall structure and the historical reasons for some of the options. Then we will go deeper into the bits and bytes and why things are laid out the way they are.  This talk will make use of the tiffhax project to explain things (https://github.com/emilyselwood/tiffhax).

# OGC APIs and the evolution of OGC standards - an update (presentation)

Gobe Hobona,	OGC

_State-of-play of the OGC API development. The work has been progressing, to develop various OGC API standards that support a variety of resources._

API technologies are in focus of standardization discussions within the geospatial community. Discussions and initiatives in the OGC reached a milestone in 2018: the release of the first of the OGC API standards. Since then work has been progressing to develop additional OGC API standards supporting a variety of resources.  OGC members & staff investigated the potential value that OpenAPI could offer to geospatial services. Existing web service standards were effectively web APIs, modernizing their means of getting content to the web required a fairly fundamental change in the underlying design. The first OGC API standard approved & published was Part 1 of the OGC API – Features standard.  The pattern “OGC API [resource]” was coined and led to initiatives to define and test draft OGC APIs for Coverages, Maps, Tiles, Styles & Processes. Outputs will support the evolution of a solid, common core and the advancement of a new generation of OGC standards leveraging modern Web API approaches

# What every GIS user should know about projections (presentation)

Ian Turton,	Astun Technology

_A frequent query raised by newcomers to QGIS is "Why don't my layers line up?"._

A frequent query raised by new comers to QGIS (and other GIS systems) is "Why don't my layers line up?". This is usually followed by a long list of things they have vainly tried to make them line up, randomly changing the canvas and layer projections with no luck.  This talk will discuss the basics of projections, coordinate reference systems and how this "magic" code affects the position of their data. Questions covered will include:  + Why do you geographers force me to worry about this? + Why doesn't it just work? + What is this Null Island you all keep going on about? + When should I change (override) the layer CRS? + What happens when I change the CRS of a layer and/or the canvas? + What is in this `.prj` file? Do I really need it?  At the end of the talk new (and older) users will have more of an understanding of what projections are and how and why they need to deal with them.

# Multispectral WebGL (demo)

Iván Sánchez Ortega

_How graphics tech (WebGL, texture formats and shaders) and multispectral imagery (GeoTIFFs with multiple bands or samples) are a perfect match._

An overview on the work done in Leaflet.TileLayer.GL (and its OpenLayers port) to let web applications consume raw GeoTIFF data (including multiple bands and pixel formats), in order to perform raster algebra in the web browser itself (that's called "edge computing" for buzzword-loving people).

# Gisquick demo presentation (demo)

Jáchym Čepický,	OpenGeoLabs

_Gisquick is an open source geospatial data publishing platform, developed around QGIS Server, Django and Vue.js libraries._

Gisquick is an open source (GNU/GPL) geospatial data publishing platform, developed around QGIS Server, Django and Vue.js libraries.

# Solving Geospatial Problems with JavaScript (presentation)

James Milner,	Dent Reality

_A overview of solving common geometry problems in JavaScript with tools like Turf.js and JSTS._

We deal with points, lines and polygons all day. Making them bend to our will can be tricky, especially on the web where our tooling might be slightly more restrained than on the desktop. This talk will dive into solve geospatial problems that require us to do things like manipulating geometries and dealing with the relationships between them. We can expect to see how we might do operations like scaling, rotating and moving geometries as well as seeing if they intersect or overlap with others. We will take a look specifically at the Turf.js and JSTS libraries that are available as JavaScript modules. It is recommended attendees have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

# Labelling cans on a production line: automating metadata creation (demo)

Jo Cook,	Astun Technology

_A demo of new tools for automatically creating metadata from spatial files or databases._

Feeling overwhelmed by the thought of creating and maintaining metadata on your many spatial datasets? Can't face the thought of editing thousands of metadata records? Never fear, metadata crawler is here. I'll demo it in action, showing how it will help you go from metadata zero to hero.

# Processing Large Geospatial Datasets on the Cloud, using FOSS (presentation)

Joana Simoes,	EarthPulse

_Learn how we tackled the tech challenges involved in processing a large volume of noisy, geospatial data, using FOSS and cloud computing._

Large volumes of geotagged network data, are generated everyday using sensor devices. If processed, these data could have an important impact in location assessment and network design and planning.  The main goal of this project was to identify Areas of Coverage (AoC) of telco antennas, within a large volume of noisy, point data. This brought two technological challenges: to find an algorithm that enabled us to detect the AoC, discarding the points which are not relevant; and to run this algorithm at scale, processing a large dataset, which covers the entire UK. The two challenges were tackled using a stack of FOSS. The resulting application was virtualised into a set of docker containers, and deployed on the AWS cloud, where the processing took place. In this presentation, we would like to present the final pipeline that successfully transformed the signals in AoC, and share some lessons learned during the design, implementation and deployment process.

# Delivering a digital register of common land in Wales with the help of Open Source Geo (demo)

Kathryn Ratcliffe,	CGI

_The project showcases the benefits of enhancing commercial technologies and products with those available in the open source geo community._

The Electronic Register of Common Land and Towns and Village Greens in Wales enables the Public to access register pages and maps freely online and local authorities will be able to, for the first time, update the registers and maps digitally. This saves time and cost for both the Public and LA’s and provides a unified register of Common Land.  The application harnesses a range of open source technologies, including GeoServer, OpenLayers, .NET Core and Linux containers, working in tandem with more commercial products, such as SQL Server to provide a performant, flexible and secure application. All of which is hosted using Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. The project helps showcase the possibilities and benefits of enhancing what would traditionally be an application comprised of commercial, closed source technologies and products, with those available in the open source geo community.

# Working with big spatial data workflows (or, what would John Snow do?) (keynote)

María Arias de Reyna Domínguez,	Red Hat

_In situations where we have to handle big spatial data, I wonder: What would John Snow do? He would like us to use the proper FOSS4G tools._

Most of our software is fueled by data. But when we deal with big spatial data, we have to deal with different data sources, formats, protocols,... that have to be processed at a speed we can't handle manually.   All of those are tedious and repetitive tasks that make developers quickly jump into scripting rough code, reinventing the wheel. Also, on this custom code, we are coupling something that should be decoupled. Could it be possible to decouple the systems while they are connected?   With Integration Processes frameworks we can make it simpler and reuse expertise from other developers. We just have to worry defining the workflow and the data mappings and our FOSS will take care of the details. If one step of our data workflow changes, we could easily upgrade our workflow definition to adapt.   On this demo we will do a basic example of how to create a spatial data workflow with free and open source tools.

# Teaching QGIS: Certification and Running QGIS in the Cloud (presentation)

Nick Bearman,	Geospatial Training Solutions / UCL

_Teaching short courses using QGIS. I will cover the QGIS Certification Programme and discuss how I hosted QGIS in Amazon WorkSpaces._

I will show how I teach my GIS short courses using QGIS, covering two different areas.  I will cover the QGIS Certification Programme (https://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/about/) and how this funds QGIS. I will also discuss how the scheme is promoted to clients/users, and the mechanism of creating certificates for course attendees. I will also discuss how I hosted QGIS in Amazon WorkSpaces on a recent course, where some of the participants couldn't install QGIS locally onto their own laptop because they didn't have admin rights. I will also discuss other options, such as OSGeoLive. 

# Managing Open Data with an Open Architecture (demo)

Pascal Coulon, CGI, Tom Colley, Welsh Government

_Delivering Open Data in Wales with the help of Open Source Geo._

The Welsh Government is responsible for the managment and publication of Open Data across Wales. The Data Map Wales platform is one of the tactical applications for the Welsh Government.  The solution was driven through the use of OSGeo based solution. The key innovative element has been driven in the use of the Geonode combined with spatial functions enabling the maximum re-use of capabilities across the solution This paper will then address the key element of architecture and governance for the implementation of a Spatial Open Architecture; including: -Use of open standards allowing a plug and play architecture where products could be replaced as solution’s requirements evolves -Use of Open Source products reducing initial investment and strengthening the use of Open Standards -Decoupling business logic from the client tier and reducing dependencies on parts of the solution.

# GeoNetwork & SEO (presentation)

Paul van Genuchten,	GeoCat BV, Jo Cook, Astun Technology 

_An evaluation of Search Engine Optimisation in GeoNetwork and how to optimize the SEO via configuration._

In 2019 the UK GeoSpatial Commission studied the usage of the UK dataportal. The group found that Search engines generate a substantial amount of their portal usage. For that reason they have developed a best practice document on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) for (spatial) data portals https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/865259/SEO_for_Data_Publishers_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf. In this presentation I present an evaluation of the standard GeoNetwork software against that best practice document and share some hints on how an administrator or data steward can optimize and monitor the SEO via configuration. I’ll also give an introduction to schema.org in GeoNetwork which feeds amongst others Google Dataset Search.

# Collecting data using QGIS and Input app (demo)

Peter Wells,	Lutra Consulting

_Using QGIS and Input app, users can go out (!!!) and collect data. Input app is a free and open source app based on QGIS with a simplified interface._

Data collection is a key part of most GIS workflows. We have created an open source app based on QGIS for Android, iOS and Windows, which allows users to take their data and QGIS projects to field. The app comes with a built-in smart syn, allowing collaborative editing of data offline between multiple users offline. 

# Extracting OpenStreetMap data for region highlights compatible with OpenMapTiles (presentation)

Roman Karavia,	Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ)	

_Want to show Hubei Province (China) on an OpenMapTiles map? This talk shows how to extract region polygons for the entire planet from OpenStreetMap._

Mapbox Vector Tiles are an established standard to create web maps with custom styling. They contain minimal data for rendering a base map, which includes boundaries between regions (countries and subdivisions) but not polygons of the regions themselves. So we can draw boundaries as needed, but we lack the data to highlight one specific region, which is a recurring need in data visualization.  We wanted our highlighted regions to line up nicely with the boundaries on the base map, so we set out to extract compatible data from OpenStreetMap. The process, which uses various existing Open Source solutions and services (Overpass API, mapshaper, tippecanoe) will be presented in this talk.  The result is an open dataset of regions which cover the entire planet. In our locator map tool, this dataset allows reporters and editors, who are not GIS experts, to highlight regions with a few simple clicks. These maps are routinely used in the online and print editons of the NZZ newspaper.

# Native support for vector tiles in QGIS (presentation)

Saber Razmjooei,	Lutra Consulting	

_With QGIS 3.14, we have introduced native support for vector tiles in QGIS. It allows users to load, render, style and generate vector tiles in QGIS._

Earlier in 2020, we ran a crowdfunding campaign to add support for vector tile in QGIS: https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/vectortile-qgis/.

# Mapping the World in 3D using Commodity Video and Photos (presentation)

Sean Gorman,	Pixel8earth Inc.	

_Empower the community to create a high accuracy 3D point cloud of the world using commodity cameras and open data._

There is an increasing demand for 3D data to power augmented reality, autonomy and gaming. Traditionally creating this data requires expensive specialty equipment like LiDAR, 3D scanners or sensor laden vehicles. Pixel8.earth is using a combination of computer vision and geomatics to achieve the same results using commodity photos and videos. The goal is to enable the community to use their existing cameras to crowdsource a a high accuracy 3D point cloud of the world.


# Running an online FOSS4G - some reflections (keynote)

Steven Feldman,	KnowWhere Consulting	

_This is the first online FOSS4G event, how did we get here? What can we learn? What does the future hold?_

This is the first online FOSS4G event, how did we get here? What can we learn? What does the future hold?  It's going to be a while before we can start meeting face to face again and even longer before we are likely to travel across continents to attend conferences. What does that mean for our OSGeo community?  FOSS4GUK Online could be a great success or stuff may have gone disastrously wrong. This presentation will be pretty spontaneous, we won't have finished FOSS4GUK online when it is delivered. I will share some of our experiences running the event, what we have already learnt and consider how online events may be a key part of our community and outreach in the future.

# Optimized publishing of map and dataservices with GeoServer, GeoStyler, GeoWebCache and MapProxy (presentation)

Till Adams,	terrestris GmbH & Co. KG

_The talk presents one Open Source toolset for the set-up of geodata-services that consists of GeoServer/GeoWebCache, GeoStyler and MapProxy._

Just a few years ago, the very existence of geo-services based on an uniform API alone aroused admiration. Now more than 10 years of INSPIRE later, this question often no longer arises. With UMN MapServer, GeoServer, deegree or QGIS Server, to name just a few, there are a number of software packages in the Open Source world, that can be used to transform geodata into standardized services. Once published as WMS or WFS, one can rely on a whole range of additional tools, functions and interfaces. Thus a user is often faced with the question on which tools can be used to achieve an optimal result in the shortest possible time.  In my talk I present one possible solution for setting-up of geodata-services. I want to show functions, possibilities and interactions of the OSGeo project GeoServer & GeoWebCache with the OSGeo Community Projects GeoStyler and MapProxy based on some examples. The talk is peppered with some hints on styling, performance tuning and caching of services.

# Big Earth Observation- and Geodata analysis with actinia and GRASS GIS (presentation)

Till Adams,	mundialis GmbH & Co. KG

_We present a cloudbased technology, that allows "big geodata analysis" in process chains, that make use of actinia and GRASS GIS._

Geo- and EO-data are more and more available, especially the growing Open Data policy of organisations fuels this process. With this awareness and demand for geo-based decision support increases. We want to present an implementation of the new paradigm of "bring processes to the data". In the talk we present how big geodata analysis process chains could be easily implemented in a cloud environment by using GRASS GIS and actinia (OSGeo project & OSGeo Community project, respectively) for the process algorithms. The combination of these allows cloud optimized geodata processing triggered through simple API-calls. In the first part we show the architectural design and the interactions between actinia and GRASS GIS. In the 2nd part we present examples of process chains. These are a) automated surface-type detection from orthophotos, b) on-demand creation of cloud free Sentinel-2 scenes using temporal interpolation, and lastly c) gap-filling of high-resolution land surface temperature data from MODIS-satellite data.

# Serverless PostGIS (demo)

Tomas Holderness,	Addresscloud	

_Learn how to create an on-demand pay-as-you-go PostGIS database with Amazon Aurora._

PostGIS, the leading relational spatial database, is now available to use with Amazon Aurora Serverless for Postgres. Amazon Aurora Serverless is differentiated from existing cloud database solutions because it supports a fully on-demand configuration. The database scales automatically when under load, and can be configured to shutdown completely when not in use. In its "cold" state the user only pays for data stored, making this ideal for variable workloads and price-sensitive applications.  This demonstration will introduce the key concepts of Aurora Serverless, and showcase database creation, configuration, and loading data via QGIS. The session is suitable for anyone who is familar working with PostGIS databases. The session will conclude with how to perform a query to the database without a connection, using the Aurora Data API in a Lambda function.  Requirements: knowledge of how to create a PostGIS database, an Amazon Web Services account if you want to follow along at home. 

# Thinking Strategically about (open) geospatial (presentation)

Will Cadell,	Sparkgeo	

_It's easy to build something because it's fun. But thinking strategically can turn a fun project into a million-dollar business, we should do that._

Geospatial people are really good at building geospatial things for geospatial people. But if we think strategically about what we are doing and why then we can identify how to make a much bigger impact on our communities. This talk will dig into what thinking strategically about open geospatial technology means, and present some tools to help the participants think through their own projects.

# OpenAQ: An open source platform to understand the world’s air quality (lightning talk)

Sruti Modekurty,	OpenAQ	

_OpenAQ uses the power of open air quality data and open source tools to convene and empower communities around the world to fight air pollution._

OpenAQ is an environmental tech non-profit that has created the world’s first open, real-time and historical air quality platform, aggregating governmental and research-grade data -- entirely open-source. The platform has over 500 million data points from 93 countries and serves 33 million API requests per month. The data have been used for a wide variety of applications, from air quality forecasts produced by NASA scientists to platforms communicating air quality in India to data-driven media reports by the general public. By providing this foundational data infrastructure, OpenAQ is able to convene people and organizations from across the globe to further raise awareness and develop innovative solutions to combat air pollution. The talk will give a technical overview of the platform, highlight the impact through user stories, and feature new tools we have developed with the community to enhance the platform and use the data to fight for change. The OpenAQ platform itself is a geospatial tool since all of the data is geo-tagged. I'll also be talking about a new averaging tool we've developed on top of the platform that allows someone to get pollutant averages across various spatial and temporal resolutions via the API. And because it's open source, the averaging tool can be used for other point data.
