### FOSS4G:UK Local 2023

**Call for Talks Extended to Mon 7th August 2023**

We have a confirmed date for [FOSS4G:UK Local 2023](foss4guklocal2023/index.html) - **Thurs 7th Sept 2023**.

<img title="FOSS4G Uk Local 2023 Logo" src="/foss4guklocal2023/images/foss4guk2023-logo.svg" style="display:block; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;"/>


[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) will be bringing together all those interested in free and open source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) for this fantastic event. If you use, promote, develop or want to learn about open source tools and open data for geospatial, then this conference is for you! 

This will be a hybrid conference, but with a twist: there will be no central physical location. We have 8 venues geographically dispersed across the UK, where you can physically meet up to attend the conference: 

- [Glasgow](foss4guklocal2023/glasgow.html) *University of Glasgow*
- [Lancaster](foss4guklocal2023/lancaster.html) *Fraser House Hub*
- [Keyworth (Nottingham)](foss4guklocal2023/keyworth.html) *British Geological Society*
- [Maynooth (Ireland)](foss4guklocal2023/maynooth.html) *Maynooth University*
- [London](foss4guklocal2023/london.html) *Geovation*
- [Swansea](foss4guklocal2023/swansea.html) *UWTSD IQ Campus*
- [Basingstoke](foss4guklocal2023/basingstoke.html) *Willis Museum*
- [Bristol](foss4guklocal2023/bristol.html) *Engine Shed*

We have two amazing keynotes: Ujaval Gandhi & Helen McKenzie. We will also have a panel discussion to mark ten years since [FOSS4G 2013 in Nottingham](http://2013.foss4g.org/),  provisionally titled: *Where have we gone in the last ten years, and where will be in ten years time?*. 

We are adopting a similar structure to last year, with the keynotes and panel discussion streamed to all venues and to YouTube. 

For more details, check out the [website](foss4guklocal2023/index.html).  

If you are interested in volunteering at one of the venues above, or have any questions, please get in touch via [our mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk){:target="_newpage"}, [our Matrix Chat Room](https://matrix.to/#/%23OSGeoUK:matrix.org){:target="_newpage"} or [OSGeoUK@gmail.com](mailto:osgeouk@gmail.com){:target="_newpage"}.

### FOSS4G:UK Local 2022

We had a great [FOSS4G:UK Local 2022](/foss4guk2022local/) conference on Thurs 17th Nov 2022. Many thanks to everyone who attended, presented and helped organise the conference. We had 246 attendees in person and ~50 online, meaning we reached a total of about 300 people on the day. We raised about £3500 for OSGeo:UK which will go towards our funding of [Open Source Geospatial software](https://uk.osgeo.org/pastdonations.html). Videos for most of the sessions are now available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FOSS4GUK/streams){:target="_newpage"}. 

We have done a short [write up](/foss4guk2022local/lessons-learned.html), summarising some of the feedback and highlighting a few of the lessons learned for next time. We're aiming to run a conference in 2023, and will be asking for volunteers early next year - so please sign up to the [mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk){:target="_newpage"} to find out when we'll be meeting to discuss this.

[FOSS4GUK Online 2020](/foss4gukonline2020/) was a big success - for an outlay of around £200, we had:

* 600 delegates from 77 countries
* 33 presentations
* £2,500 raised for OSGeo and MapAction
* 270 subscribers to our YouTube channel

[FOSS4GUK 2019](/foss4guk2019/){:target="_newpage"} has been and gone, and was an enormously successful event. Our thanks go out to the organising committee, sponsors and delegates. Videos are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0wX857AHUGM3qCzR6PcwQ){:target="_newpage"}.
